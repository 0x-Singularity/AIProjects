# AIProjects
- This repository contains various AI projects, including convolutional and fully connected neural networks, trained on datasets like Fashion MNIST to perform image classification tasks. These projects demonstrate different neural network architectures and their ability to recognize and classify types of clothing.

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- A convolutional neural network that recognizes and classifies different types of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Full Connected Neural Network 
- A simple fully connected neural network (Sequential model) that recognizes and classifies different types of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
